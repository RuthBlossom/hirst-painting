# Turtle Color Dots Art

This project uses Python's `turtle` module and the `colorgram` library to extract colors from an image and create a dot art pattern.

## Overview

The script extracts colors from a given image using the `colorgram` library, then uses the `turtle` module to draw a pattern of colored dots based on the extracted colors.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually included with Python)
- `colorgram.py` library

### Install `colorgram.py`

You can install the `colorgram.py` library using pip:

```bash
pip install colorgram.py
```

## Usage

1. **Extract Colors from Image**

   The script extracts colors from an image file and stores them in a list. Replace `'image.jpg'` with the path to your image file.

2. **Draw Dots using Turtle**

   The script uses the `turtle` module to draw dots on the screen. You can adjust the number of dots, dot size, and spacing as needed.

3. **Run the Script**

   Save the script in a Python file (e.g., `color_dots.py`) and run it:

   ```bash
   python color_dots.py
   ```

## Example

In the example script, colors are extracted from an image and used to draw a dot pattern on the screen using the `turtle` module.

## Notes

- Ensure the image file path is correct.
- Adjust the number of dots and other parameters as needed.
- The script uses `turtle` for graphical output; it will open a window displaying the dot pattern.
